# React Native Interview and Coding Challenge
This documents describes an interview to be completed asynchronously by the Full Stack candidates.

This process is comprised of 3 stages:

- Technical Questions
- Coding Challenge
- Final Debrief

# 1- Technical Questions
In this phase the candidate must answer a series of questions through video. All questions are to be answered in the candidate's "own words", that is, no pre-scripted answers should be delivered.

## Instructions
- Capture a video in which the candidate continuously answers all questions in this section.
- The video should not be edited.
- Only a single video will be delivered.
- Answers in the candidate's own words; not scripted.
- The video should be no longer than 15-30 minutes. The shorter the better.

## The Questions
Answer the following questions in 15-30 minutes max. If you do not know the answer to a question, **clearly state so** and continue with the next one. Not all questions need to be answered.

- Describe your professional experience. This must include years in the field and any relevant information you may give.
- Describe your experience in the following technologies. This must include years of experience in EACH technology and any relevant information you may give.
- React/React Native, Redux, GraphQL, NodeJS, MongoDB, Typescript, Javascript, Jest or Unit Testing
- Describe in your own words: What is React?
- Describe in your own words: How does React works?
- Describe in your own words: How does React Component Lifecycle works?
- Describe in your own words: What is the difference between props and state?
- Describe in your own words: What is the React Native bridge?
- Describe in your own words: What is Redux and why it is important?
- Describe in your own words: What is GraphQL and do you have experience?
- Describe in your own words: How does the Javascript Runtime works (event loop)?
- Describe in your own words: What are Promises?
- Describe in your own words: What is async and await and how does it relates to Promises?

# 2- Coding Challenge
This a coding exercise to test knowledge and proficiency on React Native, GraphQL and Typescript. All code must be committed to a git repository, and commit history will be proof of work done. In this challenge you will implement a small feature, covering both the front and back end.

## Instructions
- Create a mobile app that displays a list of profiles. The only requirements for this app is that it should be written in React Native and it must connect to the mock GraphQL server included with the base code provided. There are no additional UI or functional requirements.
- After your app is completed, create a 5 minute screen-share video where you present and describe your code and also demonstrate a working demo using an iOS Simulator or an Android Emulator.

## Tech Stack
These are the technologies to be used. You can use additional libraries as you see fit.
- Git
- GraphQL
- React Native
- A working app has been provided. This app was created with CRNA. Read `package.json` for details on how to run.
- A working GraphQL mock server has been provided. Read `package.json` for details on how to run.

## Deliverable
The deliverable consists of a zip file with a git repository and a working demo video. Commits to this git repo must show incremental work, **so make sure code is committed often**.
